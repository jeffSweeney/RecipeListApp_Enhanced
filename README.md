# RecipeListApp_Enhanced

This is the enhanced version of my initial recipe list app.

## Main Changes

This app incorporates multiple tab views to accomodate a featured dish page. It also
accepts user input in the form of a segmented picker, which allows the user to select
how many servings (2, 4, 6, 8) they'd like to make. Based on this input, the ingredients 
are then updated accordingly:

* Ingredient portion size is dynamically calculated based on servings chosen
* Ingredient units are made plural where needed
